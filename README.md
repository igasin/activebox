# ActiveBox Project

ActiveBox is a multipurpose responsive one-page HTML template with a clean and minimalistic design. Ideal for any project that requires a sleek landing page, it's easily adjustable to your needs and ensures a stylish and straightforward setup for your website.

This project was completed as part of my coursework on HTML and SCSS, demonstrating practical application of the skills learned.
